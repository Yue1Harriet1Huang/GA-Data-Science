      "This could be beneficial for the City to better plan its allocation of officers in various areas at various times, as well as to better prepare officers on duty to anticipate certain kinds of calls that they may receive. Additionally, it can also help people to determine whether it is worth calling in about a noise complaint or whether it would be more effective to get ear plugs!\n",

Data were accessed through NYC OpenData, which has records for all 311 calls since 2010.\n",

While the business use of this is limited, the underlying data is more beneficial to the NYPD and the City."

      "If the City wants to make their response to noise complaints more effective, they should focus on putting more officers in areas where they anticipate construction complaints, because other than helicopter noise, these are the slowest to be responded to. Perhaps the City could also put forward legal action about restricting construction to work hours or limits on where helicopters can fly. A large number of helicopter complaints stemmed from lower Manhattan, where there are private helicopter pads, so perhaps another look at this is required.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not surprisingly, noise complaints are both more common and slower to be responded to on Sundays and late at night. Knowing that this is the case, the City could optimize its resource allocation to better deal with these complaints during non-business hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even after controlling for the other factors, Manhattan had one of the slowest response times for noise complaints. This may be because the NYPD has a more difficult time getting to or isolating where noise complaints are coming from. More research would be required about the allocation of resources and information being collected from the caller to determine why this is happening.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, as the average number of complaints from a particular area increases, we saw a decrease in the expected resolve time. This may indicate that the police expect certain complaints from particular areas and are actually prepared to respond to them, but may still benefit from the information discovered here."
